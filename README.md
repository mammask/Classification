# Classification

Classification using a number of Machine Learning classifiers. In case of impbalanced classes, it performs cross validation and oversamples or undersamples the minority/ majority class during k-fold cross validation. 

In scikit-learn it is not feasible to perform cross validation and artificially balance the classes during the building of the k-folds.
